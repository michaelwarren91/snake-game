# snake-game
Clone of the classic snake game. I've only included the source files that I made leaving the library linking/include setup to whoever clones this.


Dependencies
---
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)



How To Build
---
You need to download the SDL2 libraries and headers for whichever platform you want and set up the linking and includes yourself. You may have to change the SDL2 include paths in the source files as well.



Future Goals (maybe)
---
- Textures instead of rects for snake and food
- Implement SDL2_ttf for drawing text
- An actual title screen before playing
- Scoring system
- Better input handling
- Learn CMake and make sharing this a bit easier?
